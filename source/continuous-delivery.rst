Continuous Delivery
*******************

The section follows the outline of the book Continuous Delivery

Foundations
===========

Anti-patterns
-------------

- Deploying software manually
- Deploying to a Production-like Environment Only after Development Is Complete
- Manual Configuration Management of Production Environments

Benefits of Continuous Delivery
-------------------------------

- Empowering Teams - The pipeline is a pull system, allowing testers, operations, support to self-service the version of the app
- Reducing Errors - use configuration management to store everything
- Lowering Stress - 
- Deployment Flexibility - deploy to new environments quickly 
- Practice Makes Perfect - 

Principles of Software Delivery
-------------------------------

- Create a Repeatable, Reliable Process for Releasing Software
- Automate Almost Everything
- Keep Everything in Version Control
- If It Hurts, Do It More Frequently, and Bring the Pain Forward
- Build Quality In
- Done Means Released
- Everybody is Responsible for the Delivery Process
- Continuous Improvement
