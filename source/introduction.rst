Welcome to the DevOps Notebook.  This is a project to collect and curate information and concepts related to DevOps.  We intend to cover a broad set of topics.  The purpose is not to provide detailed insight into each concept, but rather to show the bredth of related information and their interconnections, with pointers to detailed insight.  

This is a living document, that will constantly be updated as new information is uncovered and curated.
